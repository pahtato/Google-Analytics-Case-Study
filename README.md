# Google-Analytics-Case-Study

## Background

Over the past months, I have been taking the Google Data Analytics courses on 
Coursera. Throughout the course there was a heavy emphasis on the analysis 
process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act. A case study is a great 
way to showcase what I have learned and understanding from the course. Given a 
scenario and the data, with the analysis process in mind, below are my approach 
toward the case study, I'll be using R and Tableau for this report.
